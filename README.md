# Movie Rating Prediction with Python

## 🎬 Overview
This project aims to predict the rating of a movie based on features like genre, director, and actors. By analyzing historical movie data, we develop a model to estimate movie ratings accurately. This project covers data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling techniques.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset includes information about various movies, such as genres, directors, actors, and ratings. Additional features like release year, runtime, and budget may be included.

## 🛠️ Requirements
To run the code for this project, you need the following Python libraries:
- Pandas 🐼
- NumPy 🔢
- Scikit-learn 🧠


## 📝 Usage & Settings
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Explore techniques to create or transform features to improve model performance.
3. **Model Building**: Choose a regression technique (e.g., linear regression, random forest regression) and train the model.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using regression metrics like MAE, MSE, and R-squared.
5. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to make predictions on new movie data.
